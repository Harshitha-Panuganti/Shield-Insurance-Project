# Shield-Insurance-Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the virtual internship at AtliQ Technologies. The task was to assist Shield Insurance in making data-driven decisions by analysing their data from November 2022 to April 2023. To explore a potential partnership with AtliQ Technology, Shield Insurance has requested a pilot project to evaluate our capabilities. As per their project requirements, I have built a dashboard for taking smarter & faster data driven decisions.
